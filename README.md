# Sifra
### The Encrypted Ledger of Human Thought. Powered by Kaspa.

## The Manifesto (The Problem)
We are in the middle of an AI arms race. Everyone is building the next LLM to summarize the internet. But in this gold rush, we forgot the most important asset: **The Human Source**.

* **The Ad-Model is Dead:** AI summarizes content, so users don't click links. Creators lose revenue, and platforms lose relevance.
* **Censorship & Bias:** Centralized gatekeepers decide what can be published and who gets demonetized.
* **The AI Harvest:** Bots scrape human intelligence for free.

## The Solution: Sifra
Derived from the Aramaic for "Book" and the root of "Cipher".
Sifra is a decentralized publishing protocol designed for the post-AI era. It is a "Pay-Per-Insight" platform where content is encrypted by default.

**We don't rely on ads. We rely on Kaspa.**

## Why Kaspa?
* **Speed:** Decryption happens in ~1 second. It feels faster than loading a 30-second pre-roll ad.
* **Micro-Scale:** We can process transactions worth fractions of a cent without fees eating the profit. Kaspa is the only Layer-1 fast enough to make "Streaming Money" feel like "Streaming Data."

## How It Works (The MVP)
1.  **Granular Unlocking:** A reader enjoys the first paragraph for free. To read the rest, they stream a micro-payment (e.g., Pay 1 KAS).
2.  **Monetizing the AI:** If an LLM wants to scrape Sifra to train its model, it must pay for the protocol.
3.  **Social DRM (The Watermark):** If you decrypt content, your wallet address is dynamically watermarked onto the UI. If you leak it, you dox yourself.

## AI Usage Declaration
This project was built using an AI-first approach to maximize development speed during the hackathon. 
* **Architecture & Concept:** I acted as the Software Architect, defining the Sifra protocol logic, the "Pay-Per-Insight" flow, and the Kaspa wallet integration concepts.
* **Code Generation:** I utilized Replit and LLMs to generate the frontend structure (React/Vite) and boilerplate code.
* **Visual Assets:** The logo and UI components were generated/styled using AI-assisted design tools.

**Note on Commit History**
This project was developed using Replit's online IDE. The codebase was exported and pushed to GitHub as a single initial commit for submission purposes.
