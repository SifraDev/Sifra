# Sifra
### The Encrypted Ledger of Human Thought. Powered by Kaspa.

## The Manifesto (The Problem)
We are in the middle of an AI arms race. Everyone is building the next LLM to summarize the internet. But in this gold rush, we forgot the most important asset: **The Human Source**.

* **The Ad-Model is Dead:** AI summarizes content, so users don't click links. Creators lose revenue, and platforms lose relevance.
* **Censorship & Bias:** Centralized gatekeepers decide what can be published and who gets demonetized.
* **The AI Harvest:** Bots scrape human intelligence for free.

## The Solution: Sifra
Derived from the Aramaic for "Book" and the root of "Cipher".
Sifra is a decentralized publishing protocol designed for the post-AI era. It is a "Pay-Per-Insight" platform where content—starting with articles and evolving into video—is encrypted by default.

**We don't rely on ads. We rely on Kaspa.**

## Why Kaspa?
* **Speed:** Decryption happens in ~1 second. It feels faster than loading a 30-second pre-roll ad.
* **Micro-Scale:** We can process transactions worth fractions of a cent without fees eating the profit. Kaspa is the only Layer-1 fast enough to make "Streaming Money" feel like "Streaming Data."

## How It Works (The MVP)
1.  **Granular Unlocking:** A reader enjoys the first paragraph for free. To read the rest, they stream a micro-payment (e.g., Pay 1 KAS). The decryption key is delivered instantly—faster than a webpage can load an ad. You don’t pay for the whole book; you pay for the chapter.
2.  **Monetizing the AI:** We don't block AI; we treat it as a customer. If an LLM wants to scrape Sifra to train its model or summarize a post, it must pay for the protocol. We turn data scraping into a revenue stream for the human creator.
3.  **Direct P2P Flow:** 100% of the payment goes to the creator’s wallet. No middleman taking a 30% cut.
4.  **Sovereign Identity:** No emails. No phone numbers. Login is handled exclusively via Kaspa Wallet Signatures. This guarantees total anonymity.
5.  **Social DRM (The Watermark):** We don't just block right-clicks. If you decrypt content, your wallet address is dynamically watermarked onto the UI. If you leak it, you dox yourself. The community polices itself.

## The Vision (Roadmap)
Sifra is starting as a haven for writers, but the architecture is agnostic.

* **Phase 2 (Media):** We will expand to video and audio, utilizing the same "Pay-Per-Second" encryption model.
* **Phase 3 (KRC-20 Equity):** We will move from monetizing content to monetizing reputation. Using the KRC-20 standard, creators will launch "Creator Coins." This allows early fans to invest in a creator’s growth. Fans won't just "donate"; they will invest.—Imagine buying "stock" in the next investigative journalist or the next Mr. Beast before they blow up. Fans won't just consume content; they will hold a stake in the creator's success.

> *Sifra is not just a platform; it is a defense mechanism for intellectual property in the age of Artificial Intelligence. Decrypt the truth. Pay the creator. Own the network.*

## Development & Transparency

**AI Usage Declaration**
This project was built using an AI-first approach to maximize development speed during the hackathon. I used Replit and LLMs to generate the frontend structure (React/Vite) and the boilerplate code. My role was acting as the Software Architect: defining the Sifra protocol logic, designing the 'Pay-Per-Insight' flow, and integrating the Kaspa wallet concepts. The AI wrote the syntax; I designed the system.

**Note on Commit History**
This project was developed using Replit's online IDE. The codebase was exported and pushed to GitHub as a single initial commit for submission purposes.
